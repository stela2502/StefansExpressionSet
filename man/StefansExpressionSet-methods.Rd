\usage{
StefansExpressionSet(dat, Samples, class = "StefansExpressionSet",
  Analysis = NULL, name = "WorkingSet", namecol = "GroupName",
  namerow = "GeneID", usecol = "Use", outpath = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{data frame or matrix containing all expression data}

\item{Samples}{A sample description table}

\item{Analysis}{If the samples table contains a Analysis column you can subset the data already here to the Analysis here (String). This table has to contain a column filenames that is expected to connect the sample table to the dat column names.}

\item{name}{The name of this object is going to be used in the output of all plots and tables - make it specific}

\item{namecol}{The samples table column that contains the (to be set) names of the samples in the data matrix}

\item{namerow}{This is the name of the gene level annotation column in the dat file to use as ID}

\item{outpath}{Where to store the output from the analysis}

\item{annotation}{The annotation table from e.g. affymetrix csv data}

\item{newOrder}{The samples column name for the new order (default 'Order')}
}
